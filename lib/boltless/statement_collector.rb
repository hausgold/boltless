module Boltless
  # A shallow interface object to collect multiple Cypher statements. We have
  # an explicit different interface (+#add+ instead ot +#run+) from a regular
  # transaction to clarify that we just collect statements without running them
  # directly. As a result no subsequent statement can access the results of a
  # previous statement within this collection.
  #
  # Effectively, we wrap just multiple statements for a single HTTP API/Cypher
  # transaction API request.
